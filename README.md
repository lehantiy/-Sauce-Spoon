Sauce & Spoon served as the capstone project for my Google Project Management course. The project simulated a real-world scenario where in the role of project manager, Peta, I focused on updating project documentation to ensure a successful launch. The scenario was:

Sauce & Spoon is a restaurant chain that wants to expand. They are launching new menus on the tablets on each table, with the goal of making it easier for guests to order and speeding up the time it takes to get the food out.

During the project, I achieved the following results:

• Analyzed project documentation and supporting materials to identify requirements, assess stakeholders, and address potential issues.

• Developed a project charter to align project scope and objectives with stakeholder expectations.

• Defined project objectives in accordance with SMART criteria and applied negotiation skills to effectively prioritize objectives with stakeholders.

• Created a detailed project plan by reviewing documentation, conducting research, and analyzing key discussions to identify and prioritize tasks and milestones.

• Utilized effective communication techniques to develop accurate estimates of time to complete project tasks.

• Established quality management standards and evaluated project deliverables against those standards to ensure the required level of quality.
